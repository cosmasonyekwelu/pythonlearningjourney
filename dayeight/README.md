# Day 08 - Python Learning Journey.

**Date:** September 29, 2025

## Activities

1. Explored **advanced string operations**:
   - Indexing & slicing
   - String methods (`upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, etc.)
   - String formatting (`f-strings`, `.format()`)
2. Learned about **variables**:
   - Assignment & naming conventions
   - Dynamic typing
   - Multiple assignment & swapping values
3. Solved exercises:
   - Check if a string is a palindrome
   - Count the number of vowels in a string
4. Built a **Mini-Project: String Analyzer Tool**
   - Counts vowels
   - Checks palindrome
   - Reverses text
   - Reports string length

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Advanced Strings & Variables in Python
- **URL:** Self-practice + roadmap.sh/python
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Strings, indexing, slicing, methods
  - Variables, assignment, naming conventions
  - String algorithms: palindrome, vowel counter
  - Mini-project with functions for text analysis

## Key Learnings

- Strings are sequences and support **indexing & slicing** like lists.
- Python variables are dynamically typed and donâ€™t need explicit type declaration.
- Useful string methods help with cleaning and transforming text.
- Functions make string operations reusable and modular.

## Reflection

Today I leveled up my Python knowledge by mastering **strings and variables**.  
The **String Analyzer mini-project** gave me hands-on experience with real-world string manipulation.  
I now feel confident working with text data, an essential skill for any Python project.
