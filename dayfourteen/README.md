# Day 14 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** October 5, 2025

## Activities

1. Studied **Object-Oriented Programming methods**:
   - Instance methods
   - Class methods
   - Static methods
2. Explored **method types and their differences**.
3. Completed the **Weekly Review Project**:
   - Combined knowledge from Week 2 (functions, loops, conditionals, lists, dicts, OOP)
   - Built a **Student Management System**

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Methods and OOP Review Project
- **URL:** Self-practice + roadmap.sh/python
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Using `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, and instance methods
  - Managing shared data and class attributes
  - Designing a small OOP-based system with lists and dictionaries

## Key Learnings

- **Instance methods** work with individual objects and can modify their attributes.
- **Class methods** modify class-level data and are called on the class itself.
- **Static methods** are utility functions related to the class but independent of object or class state.
- Combining OOP with data structures (lists, dicts) creates organized and reusable systems.

## Reflection

Today I learned how to use different method types in classes and how to build a complete mini-system combining multiple Python concepts.  
The Student Management System helped solidify my understanding of OOP, methods, and structured programming.
