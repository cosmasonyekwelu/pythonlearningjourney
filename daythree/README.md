# Day 03 - Python Learning Journey.

**Date:** September 24, 2025

## Activities

1. Orientation Day Three

2. Core Python Concepts

Today, I had another **Zoom orientation session** and continued learning through the video
["10 Important Python Concepts in 20 Minutes"](https://youtu.be/Gx5qb1uHss4).

I practiced the concepts in [`daythree.py`](daythree.py), where each section is clearly labeled (1â€“10).

### Concepts Covered:

1. **Creating a Python file and running it**

   - Learned to create `.py` files, save them, and run using `python filename.py`.

2. **Variables & Assignment**

   - Using variables to store data (e.g., `name = "Cosmas"`, `age = 25`).

3. **Basic Data Types**

   - Common types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`.

4. **Collections**

   - `list` (ordered, mutable),
   - `tuple` (ordered, immutable),
   - `set` (unordered, unique values),
   - `dict` (key-value pairs).

5. **Type Annotations**

   - Adding hints like `def square(number: int) -> int:` for clarity and maintainability.

6. **Constants**

   - Declaring constants with `Final` (e.g., `PI: Final[float] = 3.14159`).

7. **Functions with Parameters and Return Types**

   - Writing reusable functions with input parameters and return values.

8. **Classes and `__init__`**

   - Defining classes with constructors and methods.

9. **Dunder (Magic) Methods**

   - Overriding methods like `__str__`, `__add__`, and `__eq__` to make objects more powerful.

10. **Writing Clean, Reusable Code**
    - Using `if __name__ == "__main__":` to control script execution and keep modules reusable.

### Files

- `daythree.py`: Python practice file with all 10 concepts implemented.
- `README.md`: Documentation of learning journey.

## Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on practice with **fundamental Python building blocks**.
- Learned how to structure code for **readability and reusability**.
- Understood the importance of **dunder methods** in making objects behave like built-ins.
- Practiced creating functions, classes, and constants to organize logic.

## Reflection

Day Three was a big step forward in Python. I now feel more confident writing structured, reusable code using functions and classes. I also realized the importance of clean coding practices, which will help me as I build larger projects.
