# Day 16 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** October 7, 2025


## Activities

Mastered encapsulation concepts: private and protected attributes

Implemented getter and setter methods using @property decorator

Practiced data validation through property-based encapsulation

Explored name mangling with double underscores for private attributes

Built an enhanced BankAccount class with comprehensive property-based validation

Applied encapsulation principles to create robust, secure class designs

## Tutorial

Title: Advanced OOP: Encapsulation and Properties

URL: Self-practice with Python OOP documentation

Topics Covered:

Private and protected attribute conventions

Property decorators for controlled attribute access

Data validation through setter methods

Name mangling mechanism

Encapsulation benefits for maintainability

Read-only and computed properties

## Key Learnings

Understanding the importance of encapsulation for data protection

Mastering @property decorator for creating Pythonic getters/setters

Implementing robust data validation in setter methods

Using protected attributes (_prefix) for internal use

Applying name mangling (__prefix) for attribute privacy

Designing classes with proper access control and validation

Creating computed properties that behave like attributes

## Code Examples

## Basic Property 
python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._balance = 0  # Protected attribute
    
    @property
    def balance(self):
        return self._balance

    @balance.setter
    def balance(self, value):
        if value >= 0:
            self._balance = value
        else:
            raise ValueError("Balance cannot be negative")
## Name Mangling
python
class SecureData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__secret = "confidential"  # Name mangled
        
    def get_secret(self):
        return self.__secret
## Read-only Properties
python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius
    
    @property
    def area(self):
        import math
        return math.pi * self._radius ** 2

## Practice Exercises
Bank Account Enhancement: Built a comprehensive banking class with property validation

Student Class: Created a Student class with validated GPA and email properties

Temperature Converter: Implemented temperature class with property-based conversion

Product Inventory: Designed product class with price validation and computed properties

## Mini-Project: Enhanced BankAccount System
Features Implemented:

Comprehensive balance validation with properties

Transaction history tracking with protected attributes

Account number generation with read-only properties

Overdraft protection through property setters

Audit trail using private attributes

Interest calculation with computed properties

## Reflection
Today's focus on encapsulation revealed how proper data protection leads to more robust and maintainable code. The @property decorator provided an elegant way to implement getters and setters while maintaining Pythonic syntax. Data validation in setters proved crucial for ensuring object integrity. Name mangling offered true attribute privacy, while protected attributes established clear conventions for internal use. The BankAccount project demonstrated how encapsulation transforms simple classes into production-ready components with proper access control and validation.
