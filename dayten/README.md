# Day 10 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** October 1, 2025

## Activities

1. Explored **advanced lists**:
   - Creating, slicing, and modifying lists
   - Nested lists
   - List methods (`append`, `extend`, `insert`, `pop`, `remove`)
2. Practiced **list comprehensions**:
   - Generating new lists
   - Filtering with conditions
   - Flattening nested lists
3. Solved practice problems:
   - Filter even numbers from a list
   - Flatten a 2D list

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Advanced Lists & List Comprehensions in Python
- **URL:** Self-practice + [roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python)
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Advanced list manipulation
  - Nested lists and accessing elements
  - List comprehensions with conditions
  - Flattening 2D lists

---

## Key Learnings

- Lists are **mutable**, so they can be updated dynamically.
- `append` adds a single item, while `extend` merges another list.
- `pop` removes by index (default last item), and `remove` deletes by value.
- List comprehensions make loops concise for generating and filtering lists.
- Nested lists can be flattened using **nested loops or comprehensions**.

## Reflection

Today I strengthened my ability to work with **lists**, which are one of Pythonâ€™s most powerful data structures.  
List comprehensions, especially for filtering and flattening, are a concise and pythonic way to manipulate data.
