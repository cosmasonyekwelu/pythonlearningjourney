# Day 11 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** October 2, 2025

## Activities

1. Explored **advanced dictionaries**:
   - Keys, values, and items
   - Methods: `get`, `setdefault`, `update`, `pop`, `popitem`, `copy`, `clear`
   - Iterating through dictionaries
   - Dictionary comprehensions
2. Practiced **sets**:
   - Set operations: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
   - Methods: `add`, `remove`, `discard`, `pop`
   - Comparisons: `issubset`, `issuperset`, `isdisjoint`
   - Operator-based set math (`|`, `&`, `-`, `^`)
   - Set comprehensions and membership performance
3. Solved practice problems:
   - Word frequency counter
   - Find unique values
   - Student data analysis (grades, courses, popular course)
   - Data deduplication with sets

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Advanced Dictionaries & Sets in Python
- **URL:** Self-practice + roadmap.sh/python
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Dictionary operations and comprehension
  - Set operations and performance benefits
  - Practical applications of sets for data cleaning and membership tests

## Key Learnings

- Dictionaries allow powerful mapping of keys to values, with flexible methods to update, access, and manage data.
- Iteration can be done over keys, values, or items, and comprehensions let us create complex mappings concisely.
- Sets are optimized for membership checks, making them much faster than lists for lookups.
- Set operations mirror mathematical logic (union, intersection, difference).
- Sets are useful in **deduplication** and **data validation** tasks.

## Reflection

Today I learned how to fully utilize dictionaries and sets in real-world scenarios.  
The **word frequency counter** highlighted how dictionaries can map items to counts.  
The **student data analysis** showed how sets simplify combining and analyzing course enrollments.  
The **deduplication exercise** reinforced why sets are critical for cleaning large datasets efficiently.

This practice strengthened my problem-solving toolkit by combining **mapping (dict)** and **unique collections (set)**.
