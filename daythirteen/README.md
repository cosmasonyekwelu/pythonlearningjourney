# Day 13 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** October 4, 2025

## Activities

1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - What is OOP? Why use it?
   - Defining classes in Python
   - Creating objects (instances)
   - Attributes & methods
   - The `__init__` constructor
2. Practice Project: **BankAccount class** with `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Intro to OOP (Classes & Objects) in Python
- **URL:** Self-practice + roadmap.sh/python
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Basics of OOP
  - Writing and using classes
  - The role of `__init__`
  - Adding methods for object behavior

## Key Learnings

- OOP helps organize code around **objects** (real-world entities).
- The `__init__` constructor initializes object attributes.
- Methods define the **behavior** of objects.
- Classes make code reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.
- Built a **BankAccount class** with deposit/withdraw functionality.

## Reflection

Today, I understood how Python implements **Object-Oriented Programming**.  
Creating custom classes and methods showed me how to represent real-world entities in code.  
The **BankAccount project** reinforced encapsulation of data and behavior inside objects.
