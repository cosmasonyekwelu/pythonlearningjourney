# Day 05 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** September 26, 2025

## Activities

1. Practiced core data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries

2. Explored list indexing, slicing, and comprehensions

3. Worked with tuples for immutability and unpacking

4. Used sets for unique values and operations (union, intersection, difference)

5. Built and manipulated dictionaries, including nested ones

6. Solved problem sets: reverse a list, most frequent word, merge dictionaries, remove duplicates

7. Built a Student Gradebook mini-project for managing grades and calculating statistics

## Tutorial

**Title:** Data Structures in Action & Problem Solving

**URL:** Self-practice + multiple online references

**Topics Covered:**

-Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

-Problem-solving with real-world exercises

-Student Gradebook system (mini-project)

## Key Learnings

-How to effectively use Python’s core data structures

-Solving common problems using lists, sets, and dictionaries

-The power of sets in handling unique values and operations

-Combining dictionaries and iterating over key-value pairs

-Structuring small projects with functions and reusable code

## Reflection

Today was a big step in working with data structures. I learned how each structure has unique strengths: lists for sequences, tuples for immutability, sets for uniqueness, and dictionaries for mappings. The problem-solving exercises sharpened my logical thinking, and the Gradebook project showed me how to organize data in a real-world scenario. I’m starting to feel like I can build more practical Python programs.
