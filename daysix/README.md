# Day 06 - Python Learning Journey.

**Date:** September 27, 2025

## Activities

1. Learned and practiced basic algorithms (sorting & searching).
2. Explored Python’s file handling features.
3. Worked with text and CSV files.
4. Solved exercises combining algorithms and file operations.
5. Built a Contact Book mini-project to manage and search stored contacts.

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Algorithms & File Handling
- **URL:** Self-practice + multiple online references
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, `sorted()`)
  - Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - File I/O (`open()`, `.read()`, `.write()`, `.readlines()`)
  - CSV file handling with `csv` module
  - Mini-project: Contact Book

## Key Learnings

- Difference between **linear and binary search**
- Implementation of **bubble sort** and **selection sort**
- Using Python’s built-in `sorted()` for efficient sorting
- Reading from and writing to **text and CSV files**
- Combining algorithms with file handling in real-world projects

## Reflection

Today I took a major step into **algorithms** and **file operations**.  
Understanding how sorting and searching work under the hood helped me appreciate efficiency and performance. File handling made Python feel even more practical, and the Contact Book mini-project showed me how to combine multiple skills to build something useful.
