# Day 09 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** September 30, 2025

## Activities

1. Explored **advanced conditionals**:
   - if, elif, else
   - comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
   - logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
2. Practiced **loops**:
   - `for` loops for iteration
   - `while` loops for repetition
   - `break` and `continue` statements
3. Solved practice problems:
   - FizzBuzz
   - Number Guessing Game

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Advanced Conditionals & Loops in Python
- **URL:** Self-practice + roadmap.sh/python
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Conditionals with multiple branches
  - Logical and comparison operators
  - Iteration with for/while loops
  - Loop control with break and continue

## Key Learnings

- `if/elif/else` allows branching logic.
- Comparison operators evaluate relationships between values.
- `for` loops are great for iterating through sequences, while `while` loops run until a condition is false.
- `break` exits a loop early, and `continue` skips to the next iteration.

## Reflection

Today I reinforced my understanding of **flow control** in Python.  
FizzBuzz tested logical conditions, while the number guessing game showed how to combine loops, conditionals, and user input into an interactive program.
