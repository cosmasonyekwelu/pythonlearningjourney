# Day 04 - Python Learning Journey

**Date:** September 25, 2025

## Activities

1. Learned Python control flow using `if/elif/else` statements
2. Practiced loops with `for` and `while`
3. Explored loop control using `break`, `continue`, and nested loops
4. Built a Number Guessing Game mini-project
5. Solved problem sets: Fibonacci sequence, string reversal, and pattern printing

## Tutorial

- **Title:** Control Flow Mastery & First Mini-Project
- **URL:** Self-practice + multiple online references
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Control flow (`if/elif/else`)
  - For and while loops
  - Loop control (`break`, `continue`, nested loops)
  - Number Guessing Game project
  - Problem-solving with small coding exercises

## Key Learnings

- Mastery of decision-making with conditionals
- Using loops to perform repeated tasks efficiently
- Breaking and continuing loops to control flow execution
- Writing clean solutions to common problems like Fibonacci and string reversal
- Designing and coding my first interactive Python project

## Reflection

Today I deepened my understanding of Pythonâ€™s **control flow** and **loops**. Writing small exercises helped me think logically, and building the Number Guessing Game gave me hands-on experience with interactive programming. I feel more confident tackling coding challenges now.
